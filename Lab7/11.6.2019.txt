our task will be to deliver an SSIS package that reads the transnational data from the Eddy_sales database and populate the fact table FACT_StudentDailySales in the Eddy_SalesDW database.

- You can view the data in both databases using your own login.

- In the SSISS package, you need to connect to the source and destination databases using the etl_admin user (password is given in class)

- You do not need to populate the FACT_DailySales table. The FACT_StudentDailySales is a more simplified version that you need to populate.

- You do not need to worry about populating the dimension tables.

- Your deliverable is an SSIS package file that you will upload to the Lab7 folder under Assignments.
